The State Hook
Arrays in State
28 min
JavaScript arrays are the best data model for managing and rendering JSX lists. Let’s take a look at the code for a website for a pizza restaurant.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

//Static array of pizza options offered. 
const options = ['Bell Pepper', 'Sausage', 'Pepperoni', 'Pineapple'];

export default function PersonalPizza() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState([]);

  const toggleTopping = ({target}) => {
    const clickedTopping = target.value;
    setSelected((prev) => {
     // check if clicked topping is already selected
      if (prev.includes(clickedTopping)) {
        // filter the clicked topping out of state
        return prev.filter(t => t !== clickedTopping);
      } else {
        // add the clicked topping to our state
        return [clickedTopping, ...prev];
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {options.map(option => (
        <button value={option} onClick={toggleTopping} key={option}>
          {selected.includes(option) ? 'Remove ' : 'Add '}
          {option}
        </button>
      ))}
      <p>Order a {selected.join(', ')} pizza</p>
    </div>
  );
}

In the above example, we are using two arrays:

The options array contains the names of all of the pizza toppings available.
The selected array represents the selected toppings for our personal pizza.
The options array contains static data, meaning that it does not change. It’s best practice to define static data models outside of function components since they don’t need to be recreated each time our component re-renders. In our JSX, we use the JavaScript .map() method to render a button for each of the toppings in our options array.

The selected array contains dynamic data, meaning that it changes, usually based on a user’s actions. We initialize selected as an empty array. When a button is clicked, the toggleTopping() event handler is called. Notice how this event handler uses information from the event object to determine which topping was clicked.

When updating an array in a state, we do not just add new data to the previous array. We replace the previous array with a brand new array. This means that any information that we want to save from the previous array needs to be explicitly copied over to our new array. That’s what this spread syntax does for us: ...prev.

Notice how we use the .includes(), .filter(), and .map() methods of our arrays. If these are new to you, or you just want a refresher, take a minute to review these array methods. We don’t need to be full-fledged JavaScript gurus to build React applications but know that investing time to strengthen our JavaScript skills will always help us do more faster (and have a lot more fun doing it) as React developers.
